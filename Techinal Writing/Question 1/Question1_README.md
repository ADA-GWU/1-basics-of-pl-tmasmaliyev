Introduction

Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are arranged in memory. Let's say, different languages read their text in different orders. 
For example, English reads from left to right, while Arabic reads from right to left. Endianness works similarly for computers. 
If one computer reads bytes from left to right and another reads them from right to left, issues arise when these computers need to communicate.

Endianness ensures that bytes in computer memory are read in a specific order.

Types of Endians:

Endianness comes in two primary forms: Big-endian (BE) and Little-endian (LE).

Big-endian (BE): Stores the most significant byte first. This means that the first byte (at the lowest memory address) is the largest, 
which makes it easy to read left to right.

Little-endian (LE): Stores the least significant byte first. This means that the first byte (at the lowest memory address) is the smallest, 
which makes it easy to read right to left.

What is Big-endian?

In a big-endian system, the most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address. This means the “big end” comes first. 
For instance, a 32-bit integer 0x12345678 would be stored in memory as follows in a big-endian system:

Here, 0x12 is the most significant byte, placed at the lowest address (00), followed by 0x34, 0x56, and 0x78 at the highest address (03).

What is Little-endian?

A little-endian system stores the least significant byte (LSB) at the lowest memory address. The “little end” comes first. 
For the same 32-bit integer 0x12345678, a little-endian system would store it as:

Here, 0x78 is the least significant byte, placed at the lowest address (00), followed by 0x56, 0x34, and 0x12 at the highest address (03).

Impact on Systems and Applications

Endianness is critical when systems with different architectures communicate, exchange files, or perform binary operations. For instance, network protocols, such as TCP/IP, use big-endian format to standardize data exchange across diverse systems. However, if data is not translated correctly between systems using different endianness, it can lead to incorrect results or system crashes.

Critique of Big and Little Endian

Big Endian Critique:

Advantages:

- Intuitive: Big-endian format aligns with how numbers are typically read, making it easier for humans to understand raw data dumps.

Disadvantages:

- Efficiency: Many modern CPUs are optimized for little-endian operations, which means software using big-endian data may require extra conversion steps, reducing performance.

Little Endian Critique:

Advantages:

- Performance: Little-endian format can simplify the process of loading and manipulating data. For example, it allows for easier extension of data types, as the least significant byte is in the smallest memory address, making arithmetic operations more straightforward.

- Processor Compatibility: Since most modern processors (e.g., x86) use little-endian format, it is generally more efficient to use this format for applications running on these systems.

Disadvantages:

Less Intuitive: Little-endian format can be less intuitive for humans when reading data directly, as it is stored in reverse order.

Conclusion

To sum up, Big-endian and little-endian formats have their respective advantages and drawbacks. While big-endian provides a more intuitive representation for humans and is standardized in network protocols, little-endian is more efficient for modern processors and common in the majority of personal computing systems.
